# vivaldi-arc-micro

Arc-like theme for vivaldi with minimal address bar and vertical tabs

<img src="viv-micro-preview.jpg" alt="Preview" width="50%">

I've based this theme on top of https://github.com/tovifun/VivalArc as a starting point.

See that project for instructions on how to install that base theme. I've included a copy of it here as it reflects what was working for me at this point in time and I may have made some edits.

To install the rest of my tweaks you can copy the css files here into your vivaldi CSS folder.
